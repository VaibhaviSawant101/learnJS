#Classes and Objects
Objects
A javascript object is an entity having state and behavior(properties, method)
JS object have a special property called prototype
We can set prototype using __proto__
when we create an object default object is created inside that object called as prototype
if we create an array
-we know it is object-it also has methods - push, pop
-from where is comes -it comes from prototype
-it inherit methods from prototype.
so prototype contains general methods 
-to inherit properties of other object we use prototype;
-type of prototype - reference

Classes
Class is a program-code template for creating objects.
Those objects will have some state(variables) & some behaviour (functions) inside it
class MyClass{
    constructor(){..}
    myMethod(){..}
}

let myObj = new MyClass();

Constructor() method is:
-automatically invoked by new
-initializes object

constructor(){...}

Inheritance in JS
Inheritance is passing down properties & methods from parent class to child class
class Parent{

}
class Child extends Parent{

}
If child & parent have same method, child's method will be used - Method Overriding

Super keyword
The super keyword is used to call the constructor of its parent class to access the parent properties and methods
super(args)
super.parentMethod(args)

Error Handling
try-catch
try{
    normal code
}
catch(err){
    handling error
}
