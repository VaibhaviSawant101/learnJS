JS is dynamically type language meaning
let i = 5; i = "Hello"
- no need to specify the type
- we can change the type of initialized variable with different type

Variables in JS
Variable are container to store data
Rules:
Case sensitive
$, _, digits, letters are allowed
first char - letter, $, _
reserved words cannot be variables names
write the variable name with camelCase

keyword to declare variable
let - variable cannot be redeclared but can be updated. A block scope variable
var - variable can be re declared & updated.A global scope variable
const - variable cannot be redeclared & updated. A block scope variable
const variable are written with capital letter

if variable is declared with let and print it will show undefined
if variable is declared with const and print it will show error missing initializer

#Data Types
Primitive data Types - Number, Boolean, String, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol
Non Primitive data Types - Objects(Arrays, Function)
Object - it is collection of values
eg Student => name string, age number, marks number, isPass Boolean
key : value
const student = {
    fullName : "Rahul Kumar",
    age : 20,
    cgpa : 8.2,
    isPass : true
}

const object can be changed
